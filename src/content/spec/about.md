Hey!

I'm a CS master's student at ETH, and this is my corner of the internet where I dump my thoughts, projects, and random stuff I find interesting.

You'll find:

- Study-related stuff
- Random life tips that actually work
- Gender and trans-related experiences
- Whatever else crosses my mind

No fancy mission statements or life-changing promises here - just content about things I care about or find useful.
