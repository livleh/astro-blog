Why Rokos basilisk is dumb.

There are infinitely many things we could potentially invent in the future that make our lives hell. Regardless if we helped creating it or not. The person being smart enough to program such a basilisk could just not do it. Or it could program a basilisk that kills all humans trying to create the "actual" torturing basilisk. Or even not related to AI at all. Some random person could create a deadly virus that doesn't kill people but tortures them or what ever. There is an infinite array of very bad things humans could invent. Why bother with this specific one?


To the one the basiliks simulates brains so we can never know if we are real or simulated. Like wtf this is the same logic as believing in eternal damnation in hell for not believing in some diety. There is an infinite array of terrible creators that could have created the universe. If the creator is bad to begin with I was doomed from the beginning anyway. There could be a diety that tortures anyone that engages in technology, in veganism, consuming meat whatever. It's dumb
