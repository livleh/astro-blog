summary: Tutorial how to get a US Google Voice account while living in Canada
---

In this post I will teach you how I got an American Google Voice number while living in Toronto.

First off, why would you even want that?

1. It's a free phone number as long as you have an internet connection
2. If you have a foreign data plan with good roaming options and don't want to buy an expensive Canadian one. (Lot's of places require phone numbers with +1 country code in Canada)

So know that you are convinced let's head straight to the step-by-step guide.

# Getting a phone number

You want to get a regular US phone number first. This prevents google from ever deactivating your voice account. You could try without (I didn't so try at your own risk), but if you get a regular phone number you must research:

1. Does the carrier have coverage near the border where you live?
2. Is it cheap, and can I cancel it without penalty?
3. Do they offer eSim and does my phone support that? This avoids the need for them to ship it to you. And you'd need a US postal address

I got myself a plan from [Tello](https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans). You can choose a plan with no data and minimal minutes, just enough for receiving text messages, or opt for a minimal data plan if you need to use your phone as a hotspot to set up the google voice account. You need to enter a US address if you want to create a Tello account. You can just pick a random one or I picked one of these parcel holding services for Canadians, that I used in the past.

Now just google how to set up an eSim for your particular phone and you are good to go.

# Getting your voice account

Now we need to go where there is coverage for our new phone plan. you actually have to set foot into America. I just crossed the rainbow bridge by foot and went somewhere with free wifi (eg [Niagara Falls Public Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/A1Z4RiugnbJ2M5ox5)). Once you are there you want to create a new American Google account, again using the same fake address. If they require a phone number just use your new one. You also need to know the **porting pin** number. This [reddit post](https://web.archive.org/web/20221231200716/https://old.reddit.com/r/Googlevoice/comments/zzzi8h/porting_from_tello_to_google_voice/) helped me find it.

Sorry if anything is unclear but I'm writing this post half a year after I created my account. I still hope it's useful and have fun with your Google voice account! :)
